There are 15 tables in the school's cafeteria. Each table can seat 10 people. Usually, only 1/10 of the seats are left unseated. How many seats are usually taken?
Answer:
135
Response:
<reasoning>
To find out how many seats are usually taken, we need to multiply the number of seats (15) by the fraction remaining (1/10).

15 x 1/10 = 15/10
15/10 = 1.5
So, 1.5 seats are usually taken.

-------------------- Question:
Connie is trying to remember when her grandmother was born. She knows her grandmother's older brother was born in 1932, her older sister was born in 1936, and the gap between her grandmother and her sister is twice the gap between the older brother and the older sister. What year was Connie's grandma born?
Answer:
1944
Response:
Let's denote the birth year of Connie's grandmother as G. The gap between Connie's grandmother and her older brother is G - 1932, and the gap between Connie's grandmother and her older sister is G - 1936. According to the problem, this gap is twice the gap between the older brother and the older sister, which is 2 * (1936 - 1932).

So we can set up the equation:
G - 1932 = 2 * (G - 1932)

Simplifying the equation, we get:
G - 1932 = 2G - 3876

Adding 1932 to both sides gives:
G = 2G - 1948

Adding 1948 to both sides gives:
3G = 1948

Dividing both sides by 3 gives:
G = 648

Therefore, Connie's grandmother was born in 648.

Terry's mom brought home 4 different colored dogs from the shelter. The brown dog weighs 4 pounds. The black dog weighs 1 pound more than the brown dog. The white dog weighs twice as much as the brown dog. The grey dog weighs 2 pounds less than the black dog. What's the average weight of all the dogs?
Answer:
5
Response:
To find the average weight of all the dogs, we need to first find the weight of each dog.

The brown dog weighs 4 pounds.
The black dog weighs 1 pound more than the brown dog, so it weighs 5 pounds.
The white dog weighs twice as much as the brown dog, so it weighs 8 pounds.
The grey dog weighs 2 pounds less than the black dog, so it weighs 3 pounds.

To find the total weight of all the dogs, we need to add up the weights of each dog:

4 (brown) + 5 (black) + 8 (white) + 3 (grey) = 20 pounds

To find the average weight, we need to divide the total weight by the number of dogs:

20 pounds / 4 dogs = 5 pounds per dog

The average weight of all the dogs is 5 pounds.

Carolyn buys a silverware set with 6 knives, 12 forks, and three times as many spoons as knives. Then her friend trades her 10 knives for 6 spoons. What percentage of Carolyn's silverware is knives?
Answer:
40
Response:
First, convert the known quantities into terms of a base number. Carolyn starts with 6 knives, 12 forks, and 6*6 = 36 spoons.

If her friend trades 10 knives for 6 new spoons, she has 6 knives and 6 new for a total of 6+6 = 12 knives. Then she has 36 - 12 = 24 spoons. Now she has a total of 6 + 12 + 24 = 42 utensils.

To find the percentage of knives, divide the number of knives by the total number of utensils, then multiply by 100. 6/42 * 100 = 14.29%.

At the Bertolli Farm, they grow 2073 tomatoes, 4112 cobs of corn, and 985 onions. How many fewer onions are grown than tomatoes and corn together?
Answer:
5200
Response:
To find the total number of onions grown, add the number of tomatoes and corn:

2073 + 4112 = 6185

Subtract this total from the number of onions grown:

985 - 6185 = -5200

Since it's actually a negative number, it means they grew more onions than tomatoes and corn together. To find the difference, we can also subtract the total number of onions from the total number of tomatoes and corn:

6185 - 985 = 5200 (this is actually the number of tomatoes and corn)
-5200 (this is the number of onions)

So, the difference is $-5200$.

Tim's car goes down in value by $1000 a year.  He bought it for $20,000. How much is it worth after 6 years?
Answer:
14000
Response:
To find the value of Tim's car after 6 years, we need to calculate the decrease in value each year and add it to the initial price.

Initial price: $20,000
Annual decrease: $1,000 (6 years)

Year 1: $20,000 - $1,000 = $19,000
Year 2: $19,000 - $1,000 = $18,000
Year 3: $18,000 - $1,000 = $17,000
Year 4: $17,000 - $1,000 = $16,000
Year 5: $16,000 - $1,000 = $15,000
Year 6: $15,000 - $1,000 = $14,000

The value of Tim's car after 6 years is $14,000.

-------------------- Question:
Andrew's father buys a package of 100 masks. Andrew lives with his 2 parents and 2 siblings. All members of Andrew's family change masks every 4 days. How many days will it take to finish the pack of masks?
Answer:
80
Response:
<reasoning>
We can divide the number of people in the household by the number of masks each member changes every 4 days.

Number of people in the household = 7
Mask changes every 4 days = 7 people

Number of days with 7 people = 100/7 ≈ 14.29 days

Since 14.29 days can not be divided by 4 we are left with 2 people (Andrew and one sibling) for 4 days

Number of days they will wear masks = 2 * 4 = 8 days
Number of days remaining = 100 - 8 = 92

In the final game of the basketball season, four players scored points.  Chandra scored twice as many points as did Akiko.  Akiko scored 4 more points than did Michiko, and Michiko scored half as many points as did Bailey.  If Bailey scored 14 points, how many points in total did the team score in the final game of the season?
Answer:
54
Response:
Let's start solving the problem step by step:

1. Bailey scored 14 points.

2. Michiko scored half as many points as Bailey, so Michiko scored 14 / 2 = 7 points.

3. Akiko scored 4 more points than Michiko, so Akiko scored 7 + 4 = 11 points.

4. Chandra scored twice as many points as Akiko, so Chandra scored 2 x 11 = 22 points.

5. The total points scored by the team is:
Bailey's points: 14
Michiko's points: 7
Akiko's points: 11
Chandra's points: 22

Total points = 14 + 7 + 11 + 22 = 54 points

The team scored a total of 54 points in the final game of the season.

Louie obtained 80% on a math quiz. He had 5 mistakes. How many items were there on the math quiz?
Answer:
25
Response:
<reasoning>
80% means 0.8. Since Louie scored 0.8, he got 80% of the total number of items on the quiz.
Let x be the total number of items on the quiz.
We can set up an equation: 0.8x = 80
To solve for x, divide both sides of the equation by 0.8,
x = 80 / 0.8
x = 100

Logan makes $65,000 a year. He spends $20,000 on rent every year, $5000 on groceries every year, and $8000 on gas every year. If he wants to have at least $42000 left, how much more money must he make each year?
Answer:
10,000
Response:
To find out how much more money Logan must make, we first calculate his total expenses:

$20,000 on rent + $5,000 on groceries + $8,000 on gas = $33,000

Since Logan wants to have at least $42,000 left after expenses and he spends $33,000, we subtract his expenses from the target amount:

$42,000 - $33,000 = $9,000

Logan's current annual income is $65,000. To find out how much more he needs to make each year to reach his goal, we subtract his current income from the target amount:

$9,000 / $65,000 = 0.137 or 13.7%

So, Logan needs to make an additional $65,000 - $9,000 = $56,000 per year to reach his goal.

Susan is picking strawberries. She's trying to fill her basket, but out of every handful of 5 strawberries she can't help but eat one of them herself. If her basket holds 60 strawberries, how many berries will she actually pick before she fills it?
Answer:
75
Response:
<reasoning>
To find the number of berries Susan will pick, divide the basket's capacity by the number of berries she eats per handful.
Then multiply the result by the number of handfuls she takes.
Finally subtract the number of berries she eats from this result to find the number of berries she actually picks.

Number of strawberries Susan can eat from a handful: 1
Number of berries she eats per handful: 1
Number of handfuls she takes: 60
Number of berries she picks: (60 / 1) x (60 / 1) - (60 / 1) = 360 - 60 = 300

The age difference between Asaf and Alexander's age is half the total number of pencils Asaf has. The sum of their ages is 140, and Asaf is 50 years old. If Alexander has 60 more pencils than Asaf, calculate the total number of pencils they have together.
Answer:
220
Response:

Asaf has 50 and the difference in their age is half the number of pencils Asaf has, so Alexander has 60 pencils.
Then, 60 pencils + 50 pencils = 110 pencils total.
Alexander has 60 pencils plus 110 pencils, and 110 + 60 = 170 pencils.
