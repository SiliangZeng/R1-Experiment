Every Monday to Friday morning, Alice walks 10 miles through a large grass field to get to school. To avoid the hot afternoon sun on her way home, she walks 12 miles through a forest. When she gets home on Friday, how many miles will she have walked that week?
Answer:
110
Response:
<reasoning>
Alice walks 10 miles to school and 12 miles back home, for a total of 10 + 12 = 22 miles.
There are 5 days from Monday to Friday.
So she walks 22 * 5 = 110 miles that week.

Boston had .5 feet of snow on the first day of winter.  The next day they got an additional 8 inches.  Over the next 2 days, 2 inches of the snow melted.  On the fifth day, they received another 2 times the amount of snow they received on the first day.  How many feet of snow do they now have?
Answer:
2
Response:
<reasoning>
Initially, they had.5 feet of snow.
Then they received an additional 8 inches, which is
(8 * 12) + 0.5 = 99.5 feet of snow.
Over the next 2 days, 2 inches of the snow melted
so 99.5 - 2 = 97.5 feet of snow.
On the fifth day, they received 2 times the amount of snow they received on the first day,
which is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot of snow.
Now, they have 97.5 + 1 = 98.5 feet of snow.

For a school fundraiser, Tory needs to sell 50 packs of cookies. So far, he has sold 12 packs to his grandmother, 7 packs to his uncle, and 5 packs to a neighbor. How many more packs of cookies does Tory need to sell?
Answer:
26
Response:
<reasoning>
To find out how many packs of cookies Tory needs to sell, first find the total number of packs sold by adding the packs sold to his grandmother, uncle and the pack sold to the neighbor and divide by 3 since he needs 50 packs in total.
12 + 7 + 5 = 24 packs sold
50 - 24 = 26 packs left

Issac has to buy pens and pencils for the upcoming school year. Issac buys 108 writing utensils total. He buys 12 more than 5 times the number of pencils than pens. How many pens did Issac buy?
Answer:
16
Response:
<reasoning>
Let p be the number of pens and q be the number of pencils.
Then the equation to represent the situation is:
q = 5p + 12.
Also, q + p = 108.
Substituting for q in the second equation gives p + 5p + 12 = 108.
6p + 12 = 108.
6p = 96.
p = 16.

Therefore, Issac bought 16 pens.

After Bellaâ€™s ballet performance, she received 2 dozen roses from her parents, and 2 roses from each of her 10 dancer friends.  How many roses did Bella receive?
Answer:
44
Response:
To find the total number of roses Bella received, we need to find the total number of roses from her parents, and the total number of roses from her friends.

2 dozen roses = 2 x 12 = 24 roses
Total roses from Bella's parents = 2 roses
Total roses from Bella's friends = 10 x 2 = 20 roses

Total roses = 24 + 2 + 20 = 46 roses

Bella received a total of 46 roses.

In a classroom there are 30 students. 1/3 of them are boys. Among the girls, 40% own dogs, 20% own a cat, and the rest have no pets. How many girls in the class have no pet?
Answer:
8
Response:
<reasoning>
To find the number of girls in the class, we need to find 1/3 of 30 students.
1/3 * 30 = 10.
So there are 10 girls in the class.
40% own a dog, so 0.40 * 10 = 4 girls have a dog.
20% own a cat, so 0.20 * 10 = 2 girls own a cat.
To find the number of girls who have no pets, subtract the number of girls with dogs and cats from the total number of girls.
10 girls - 4 girls - 2 girls = 4 girls.

John has 25 horses.  He feeds each horse twice a day and feeds them 20 pounds of food at each feeding.  He buys half ton bags of food.  How many of those will he have to buy in 60 days?
Answer:
60
Response:
To find out how many bags of food John needs, we need to calculate the total amount of food he feeds his horses in 60 days.

Each horse is fed twice a day, and each horse eats 20 pounds of food. So, each horse eats 2 x 20 = 40 pounds of food per day.

Since there are 365 days in a year, John feeds his horses for 60 / 365 = 0.164 days per year. Multiply this by the amount of food each horse eats per day to get the total amount of food each horse eats in a year.

0.164 days/year x 40 pounds/day = 6.48 pounds/year per horse

Now, multiply the amount of food per horse per year by the number of horses John has to get the total amount of food per year.

6.48 pounds/year/horse x 25 horses = 160.8 pounds/year

Since John buys half-ton bags of food, which equals 2000 pounds, we need to divide the total amount of food per year by the weight of the food.

160.8 pounds/year / 2 pounds/bag = 80.4 bags/year

Round down to 80 bags per year, since you cannot buy a fraction of a bag.

80 bags per year

So, John will need to buy 80 bags of food in 60 days.

Marsha works as a delivery driver for Amazon. She has to drive 10 miles to deliver her first package, 28 miles to deliver her second package, and half that long to deliver her third package. If she gets paid $104 for the day, how many dollars does she get paid per mile?
Answer:
2
Response:
<reasoning>
To find Marsha's pay per mile, we need to divide her total pay for the day by the total distance she drove.
First Package: 10 miles = $10
Second Package: 28 miles = $28
Third Package: Half of the miles is 28 / 2 = 14 miles
Total miles driven is 10 + 28 + 14 = 52 miles
Pay per mile = Total pay / Total miles = $104 / 52 = $2 per mile

Mike spent 37 dollars on notebooks.  He bought a total of 12 notebooks.  He bought 3 red notebooks at 4 dollars each, 2 green notebooks at 2 dollars each, and the rest were blue notebooks.  How much does each blue notebook cost?
Answer:
3
Response:
<reasoning>
To find the cost of both red and green notebooks, multiply their respective prices by the number of notebooks they were bought.
3 red notebooks: 3 * 4 dollars = $12
2 green notebooks: 2 * 2 dollars = $4
Total spent on red and green notebooks: $12 + $4 = $16
The money spent on blue notebooks is $37 - $16 = $21
To find the cost of each blue notebook, divide $21 by the number of blue notebooks: 21 / 12 = 1.75 dollars per notebook.

Riku has 25 times more stickers than Kristoff. If Kristoff has 85 stickers, how many stickers does Riku have?
Answer:

Response:
To find the number of stickers Riku has, we need to multiply the number of stickers Kristoff has by 25 and then add Kristoff's stickers to the product.

Number of stickers Kristoff has = 85
Number of stickers Riku has = 25 x 85 = 2125
Number of stickers Riku has = 2125 + 85 = 2210

If 3 crows eat 30 worms in one hour, how many worms will 5 crows eat in 2 hours?
Answer:
100
Response:
To find out how many worms 5 crows will eat in 2 hours, we need to first determine how many worms 1 crow eats in 1 hour.

Since 3 crows eat 30 worms in 1 hour:
1 crow eats 30 / 3 = 10 worms in 1 hour.

Now, to find out how many worms 5 crows eat in 2 hours:
5 crows eat 5 x 10 = 50 worms in 1 hour.
So, in 2 hours, 5 crows will eat 2 x 50 = 100 worms.

Therefore, 5 crows will eat 100 worms in 2 hours.

-------------------- Question:
A watermelon stand sold 46 watermelons. Seventeen customers bought one melon, three customers bought three melons, and the rest bought two melons. How many customers bought two watermelons?
Answer:
10
Response:
To find the number of customers who bought two watermelons, we need to first find the total number of melons bought by the customers who bought one melon or three melons.

Seventeen customers bought one melon, so they bought 17 watermelons.
Three customers bought three melons, so they bought 3 x 3 = 9 watermelons.

The total number of watermelons bought by these customers is 17 + 9 = 26.

The remaining watermelons bought by customers of other types were 46 - 26 = 20 watermelons.

Since the customers who bought two melons bought 20 watermelons, we can divide 20 by 2 to get the number of customers who bought two watermelons:

20 / 2 = 10

Therefore, 10 customers bought two watermelons.
