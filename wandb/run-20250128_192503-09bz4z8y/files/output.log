-------------------- Question:
Ahmed and Emily are having a contest to see who can get the best grade in the class. There have been 9 assignments and Ahmed has a 91 in the class. Emily has a 92. The final assignment is worth the same amount as all the other assignments. Emily got a 90 on the final assignment. What is the minimum grade Ahmed needs to get to beat Emily if all grades are whole numbers?
Answer:
100
Response:
To determine the minimum grade Ahmed needs to beat Emily, we first need to calculate the total class grade based on the assignments completed so far and the final assignment grades.

1. Calculate the total grade Ahmed has:
\[ \text{Ahmed's total grade} = 91 \times 9 = 819 \]

2. Calculate the total grade Emily has with the final assignment included:
\[ \text{Emily's total grade} = 92 + 90 = 182 \]

3. Since there are 10 assignments in total with the final assignment worth whatever score Emily scored, let \( x \) be Ahmed's grade in the final assignment. To beat Emily, Ahmed's total grade must be higher than Emily's total grade.

4. Ahmed's total grade becomes:
\[ 819 + x \]

5. Set the inequality for Ahmed to beat Emily:
\[ 819 + x > 182 \]

6. Solve for \( x \):
\[ x > 182 - 819 \]
\[ x > -637 \]

Since a grade is a whole number, the minimum possible value for \( x \) (the final assignment grade that would allow Ahmed to beat Emily) is:
\[ x = 0 \]

However, this result implies that Ahmed could get a grade below zero, which is not possible. Therefore, we must re-evaluate our approach to ensure \( x \) is correctly interpreted within the context of a whole number grade.

Given that the problem constraints are that total grades are whole numbers and the final assignment score (90) is considered separately, the only logical interpretation is that Ahmed needs to get a score that is greater than Emily's current total grade plus 9 points (the value of the final assignment), i.e., \( 182 + 9 = 191 \).

Thus, the minimum grade Ahmed needs to get on the final assignment to beat Emily would be:
\[ x = 191 - 819 \]
\[ x > -637 \]

Since \( x \) must be a positive whole number, the minimum grade Ahmed needs is:
\[ x = 191 \]

So,
\[ x \text{ could be } 191 \]

Therefore, the minimum grade Ahmed needs to get to beat Emily is 191.
Extracted:
To determine the minimum grade Ahmed needs to beat Emily, we first need to calculate the total class grade based on the assignments completed so far and the final assignment grades.

1. Calculate the total grade Ahmed has:
\[ \text{Ahmed's total grade} = 91 \times 9 = 819 \]

2. Calculate the total grade Emily has with the final assignment included:
\[ \text{Emily's total grade} = 92 + 90 = 182 \]

3. Since there are 10 assignments in total with the final assignment worth whatever score Emily scored, let \( x \) be Ahmed's grade in the final assignment. To beat Emily, Ahmed's total grade must be higher than Emily's total grade.

4. Ahmed's total grade becomes:
\[ 819 + x \]

5. Set the inequality for Ahmed to beat Emily:
\[ 819 + x > 182 \]

6. Solve for \( x \):
\[ x > 182 - 819 \]
\[ x > -637 \]

Since a grade is a whole number, the minimum possible value for \( x \) (the final assignment grade that would allow Ahmed to beat Emily) is:
\[ x = 0 \]

However, this result implies that Ahmed could get a grade below zero, which is not possible. Therefore, we must re-evaluate our approach to ensure \( x \) is correctly interpreted within the context of a whole number grade.

Given that the problem constraints are that total grades are whole numbers and the final assignment score (90) is considered separately, the only logical interpretation is that Ahmed needs to get a score that is greater than Emily's current total grade plus 9 points (the value of the final assignment), i.e., \( 182 + 9 = 191 \).

Thus, the minimum grade Ahmed needs to get on the final assignment to beat Emily would be:
\[ x = 191 - 819 \]
\[ x > -637 \]

Since \( x \) must be a positive whole number, the minimum grade Ahmed needs is:
\[ x = 191 \]

So,
\[ x \text{ could be } 191 \]

Therefore, the minimum grade Ahmed needs to get to beat Emily is 191.

Marie has 98 unread messages on her phone. She decides to clear them by reading 20 messages a day. However, she also gets 6 new messages a day. How many days will it take her to read all her unread messages?
Answer:
7
Response:
To solve this, we need to consider both the messages she reads and the new messages she gets each day. The net decrease in unread messages per day is \(20 - 6 = 14\) messages.

Marie starts with 98 unread messages and needs to end up at 0 messages. The total net decrease needed is 98 messages. So, the number of days it will take her to read all her unread messages is \(98 \div 14 = 7\) days.

Therefore, the answer is 7 days.

Mary bought a packet of 1500 stickers. She shared them between Susan, Andrew and Sam in the ratio 1:1:3 respectively. If Sam gave Andrew two-thirds of his own share, how many stickers does Andrew now have?
Answer:
900
Response:
Let's start by determining how many stickers each person initially received.

The total number of stickers is 1500, and they are shared in the ratio 1:1:3 between Susan, Andrew, and Sam. This means that Andrew will get 1/5 of the total number of stickers because \(1 + 1 + 3 = 5\) parts in total.

We calculate Andrew's share as follows:
\[
\text{Andrew's share} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1500 = 300
\]

Next, Sam gives Andrew two-thirds of his share. First, we calculate how many stickers Sam can give:
\[
\text{Sam's share} = 300
\]
\[
\text{Stickers Sam gives to Andrew} = \frac{2}{3} \times 300 = 200
\]

After receiving these stickers, Andrew's new total is:
\[
\text{Andrew's new total} = 300 + 200 = 500
\]

Thus, Andrew now has \boxed{500} stickers.

A thirsty traveler found an oasis in the desert. He drank 32 ounces of water. His camel drank seven times as much as he did. There are 128 ounces in a gallon. How many gallons of water did they drink altogether?
Answer:
2
Response:
To find out how many gallons of water they drank altogether, we first need to calculate the amount of water the camel drank. The traveler drank 32 ounces, and the camel drank seven times as much.

\( \text{Camel's water} = \text{Traveler's water} \times 7 \)

\( \text{Camel's water} = 32 \times 7 \)

\( \text{Camel's water} = 224 \) ounces

Now, we add the amount the traveler drank to the amount the camel drank to get the total amount in ounces:

\( \text{Total water} = \text{Traveler's water} + \text{Camel's water} \)

\( \text{Total water} = 32 + 224 \)

\( \text{Total water} = 256 \) ounces

To convert ounces to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon is equal to 128 ounces:

\( \text{Total gallons} = \frac{\text{Total water}}{\text{Ounces per gallon}} \)

\( \text{Total gallons} = \frac{256}{128} \)

\( \text{Total gallons} = 2 \) gallons

So, they drank a total of 2 gallons of water altogether.

Frank invites his friends over to play video games. He bakes a pan of brownies before he arrives. He cuts 6 even columns and 3 even rows into the pan of brownies. If there are 6 people, including Frank, in total, how many brownies can they each eat?
Answer:
3
Response:
First, let's calculate the total number of brownies. Frank cuts the pan into 6 even columns and 3 even rows, which means he has a total of 6 x 3 = 18 brownies.

Now, there are 6 people in total, including Frank, and they will divide the brownies equally among themselves. To find out how many brownies each person can eat, we divide the total number of brownies by the number of people:

18 brownies ÷ 6 people = 3 brownies per person

So, each person can eat 3 brownies.

Cathy and Chris got summer jobs at the cake shop and were supposed to work 20 hours per week each for 2 months. During that time, Chris got sick for one week and Cathy took her shifts. If there are four weeks in a month, how many hours did Cathy work during the 2 months?
Answer:
180
Response:
To calculate how many hours Cathy worked during the 2 months, let's break down the problem:

1. Each of them is supposed to work 20 hours per week, for 2 months.

2. There are 4 weeks in a month, so in 2 months there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weeks.

3. Chris was sick for 1 week, so Cathy took her shifts during that week.

4. This means Cathy worked for 7 weeks (since one week was taken by Chris) plus the week she worked instead of Chris (which is not counted as a "taken" week) plus the week she didn't work (since Chris was sick).

5. So, Cathy worked \(7 + 1 = 8\) weeks.

Therefore, Cathy worked 8 weeks of 20 hours per week, resulting in \(8 \times 20 = 160\) hours.

Let's calculate this explicitly:

\(8 \text{ weeks} \times 20 \text{ hours/week} = 160 \text{ hours}\)

So, Cathy worked 160 hours during the 2 months.

John uses the bathroom every 50 minutes.  How many times does he use the bathroom during a 2.5-hour movie?
Answer:
3
Response:
To determine how many times John uses the bathroom during a 2.5-hour movie, we first need to convert the movie duration into minutes, since the bathroom usage frequency is given in minutes.

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we can divide the total movie duration in minutes by the frequency of toilet visits to find out how many times John uses the bathroom during the movie.

150 minutes / 50 minutes/visit = 3 visits

So, John uses the bathroom 3 times during a 2.5-hour movie.

John went on a mission that was supposed to take 5 days.  Instead it took 60% longer.  He then had to go on a second mission which took 3 days.  How long was he on missions?
Answer:
11
Response:
To determine the total duration John spent on missions, we need to first calculate the duration of the first mission and then add the duration of the second mission.

1. Calculate the duration of the first mission:
   - The first mission was supposed to take 5 days.
   - It actually took 60% longer than planned.
   - To find the actual duration, we multiply the planned duration by 100% (planned duration) and then by 60% (increase):
     \[
     \text{Actual duration of the first mission} = 5 \text{ days} \times (1 + 0.60) = 5 \text{ days} \times 1.60 = 8 \text{ days}
     \]

2. Add the duration of the first mission to the duration of the second mission:
   - The second mission took 3 days.
   - Therefore, the total duration is:
     \[
     \text{Total duration} = 8 \text{ days} + 3 \text{ days} = 11 \text{ days}
     \]

Thus, John was on missions for a total of 11 days.

The answer is \(\boxed{11}\) days.

Michael has two brothers. His oldest brother is 1 year older than twice Michael's age when Michael was a year younger. His younger brother is 5 years old, which is a third of the age of the older brother. What is their combined age?
Answer:
28
Response:
To solve this problem, let's denote Michael's current age as M, his oldest brother's age as O, and his younger brother's age as Y.

From the information given:

1. Michael's older brother is 1 year older than twice Michael's age when Michael was a year younger. So, if Michael was A years old when he was a year younger, then the older brother would be 2 * A + 1 years old. Since Michael is currently M years old, this means that O = 2 * (M - 1) + 1 = 2M - 1.

2. His younger brother is 5 years old, which is a third of the age of the older brother. So, Y = 1/3 * O.

3. The problem states that the younger brother is 5 years old, so Y = 5.

Using the age relationship between the younger brother, Michael, and the older brother, we can substitute O from the first equation and Y from the third equation:

5 = 1/3 * (2M - 1)

Now, solve for M:

5 = (2M - 1)/3
15 = 2M - 1
16 = 2M
M = 8

Now we know Michael's age is 8, so the older brother's age is:

O = 2 * M - 1
O = 2 * 8 - 1
O = 16 - 1
O = 15

And since Y = 5, the younger brother's age is 5.

The combined age of Michael, his older brother, and his younger brother is:

M + O + Y
8 + 15 + 5
30

So, their combined age is 30 years old.
