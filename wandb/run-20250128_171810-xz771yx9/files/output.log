Fiona completed 36 math questions in an hour. Shirley was able to complete twice as many math questions within that same time, and Kiana completed half of the sum of Fiona and Shirley's math questions. If they each did the same number of questions the following hour, how many math questions did all three girls complete in 2 hours?
Answer:
324
Response:
<reasoning>
Fiona completed 36 questions in the first hour.
Shirley completed twice as many questions as Fiona which equals 36 * 2 = 72 questions.
The sum of Fiona and Shirley's questions is 36 + 72 = 108 questions.
Kiana completed half of this sum, which equals 108 / 2 = 54 questions.
Total number of questions completed by all three girls is 36 + 72 + 54 = 162 questions.

Layla is feeding her pet fish. She has two Goldfish which each get one teaspoon of fish food. Her 3 Swordtails each get 2 teaspoons of food. Her 8 Guppies each eat half a teaspoon of food. How much food does she have to give to her fish in total?
Answer:
12
Response:
<reasoning>
To calculate the amount of food Layla has to give her fish, we need to calculate the total amount of food each type of fish eats and then add them all together.

- Goldfish: 2 * 1 teaspoon = 2 teaspoons
- Swordtails: 3 * 2 teaspoons = 6 teaspoons
- Guppies: 8 * 0.5 teaspoons = 4 teaspoons

Total amount of food = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12 teaspoons

The price per organic egg is 50 cents. The price of a tray of eggs that contains 30 eggs is $12. How much can you save, in cents, per egg if you buy a tray versus individual eggs?
Answer:
10
Response:
<reasoning>
To find the price per egg, first find the cost of 30 eggs and then divide by 30.
30 eggs * $0.50 = $15.00
$15.00 / 30 eggs = $0.50 per egg

Janet has a business selling custom collars for dogs and cats. If it takes 18 inches of nylon to make a dog collar and 10 inches to make a cat collar, how much nylon does she need to make 9 dog collars and 3 cat collars?
Answer:
192
Response:
<reasoning>
To find the total number of inches needed, add the inches needed for the dog collars and the inches needed for the cat collars.
9 dog collars * 18 inches/dog collar = 162 inches

Ben's new car cost twice as much as his old car. He sold his old car for $1800 and used that to pay off some of the cost of his new car. He still owes another $2000 on his new car. How much did his old car cost, in dollars?
Answer:
1900
Response:
Let's denote the cost of Ben's old car as x.

Since his new car cost twice as much as his old car, the new car cost 2x.

Ben sold his old car for $1800. The problem states that he used that money to pay off some of the cost of his new car. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

1800 = 2x - x
1800 = x

So, Ben's old car cost $1800.

Ben still owes $2000 on his new car. Therefore, his new car's cost is:

2x = 2000 + 1800
2x = 3800
x = 1900

So, Ben's old car cost $1900.

James runs a TV show and there are 5 main characters and 4 minor characters.  He pays the minor characters $15,000 each episode.  He paid the major characters three times as much.  How much does he pay per episode?
Answer:
285,000
Response:
Let's start by calculating the total pay for the minor characters:

5 minor characters x $15,000/episode = $75,000

Now, let's calculate the pay for the major characters. Since they receive the same amount as the minor characters, they earn $15,000 x 3 = $45,000.

To find the total amount James pays per episode, add the total pay for minor and major characters:

$75,000 + $45,000 = $120,000

James would pay $120,000 per episode.

Jason has a moray eel that eats 20 guppies a day and 5 betta fish who each eat 7 guppies a day. How many guppies per day does she need to buy?
Answer:
55
Response:
To find the total number of guppies Jason needs, we need to calculate how many guppies all of them eat.

The moray eel eats 20 guppies a day, and the 5 betta fish eat 5 x 7 = 35 guppies a day. So, in total, Jason needs to buy 20 + 35 = 55 guppies a day.

The answer is 55.

Tas and his friends put up a t-shirt for sale. They ended up selling 200 t-shirts in 25 minutes. Half of the shirts were black and cost $30, while the other half were white and cost $25. How much money did they make per minute during the sale?
Answer:
220
Response:
<reasoning>
First, find out the number of black and white shirts sold. Since half were black, that's (1/2) * 200 = 100 black shirts. Therefore, the other half were white, which is also 100 shirts.
The price for each black shirt is $30, and for each white shirt is $25. Total revenue from black shirts is 100 * $30, and total revenue from white shirts is 100 * $25.
Total revenue from all shirts is 100 * $30 + 100 * $25 = $3000.
Total time spent selling is 25 minutes, so revenue per minute is $3000 / 25 = $120 per minute.

Dorothy spent $53 to buy doughnut ingredients. If she made 25 doughnuts and sells each for $3, how much was her profit?
Answer:
22
Response:
To find Dorothy's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

Total revenue = Number of doughnuts sold * Price per doughnut
Total revenue = 25 * $3
Total revenue = $75

Total cost = Cost of ingredients
Total cost = $53

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $75 - $53
Profit = $22

Dorothy's profit is $22.

If Buzz bought a pizza with 78 slices at a restaurant and then decided to share it with the waiter in the ratio of 5:8, with Buzz's ratio being 5, what's twenty less the number of slices of pizza that the waiter ate?
Answer:
28
Response:
To find the number of slices the waiter ate, first calculate the total number of slices: 78.

The waiter ate 5/13th of the pizza in his ratio 5:8. First convert 5/13th to a decimal or fraction to make it easier:
(5/13) = 0.3846 (rounds to 3 decimal places).

Multiply 0.3846 by 78 to get the total number of slices the waiter ate:
0.3846 * 78 = 30.059, round to 30 slices.

Now, subtract 20 from the number of slices the waiter ate:
30 - 20 = 10

The answer is 10.

Edith is a receptionist at a local office and is organizing files into cabinets. She had 60 files and finished organizing half of them this morning. She has another 15 files to organize in the afternoon and the rest of the files are missing. How many files are missing?
Answer:
15
Response:
<reasoning>
Since Edith has organized half of the 60 files, she has organized 60 / 2 = 30 files.
Therefore, the number of files she has left to organize is 60 - 30 = 30 files.
After organizing 15 more files in the afternoon, the total number of files left to organize is 30 + 15 = 45 files.
Since Edith is missing all the remaining files, the number of missing files is 45.

Prejean's speed in a race was three-quarters that of Rickey. If they both took a total of 70 minutes to run the race, calculate the total number of minutes that Rickey took to finish the race.
Answer:
40
Response:
Let's denote the time it took Rickey to finish the race as 'r' minutes. Since Prejean's speed was three-quarters of Rickey's, Prejean's time can be represented as r/3.

The sum of their times is given as 70 minutes, so we can write the equation as:

r + r/3 = 70

To solve for 'r', we can multiply both sides by 3:

3r + r = 210

4r = 210

Dividing both sides by 4:

r = 210/4
r = 52.5

So, Rickey took 52.5 minutes to finish the race.
