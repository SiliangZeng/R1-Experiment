The gauge on a water tank shows that the tank is 1/3 full of water. To fill the tank, 16 gallons of water are added. How many gallons of water does the tank hold when full?
Answer:
24
Response:
<reasoning>
To find the total capacity of the tank, let's call the full capacity "x". When the tank is 1/3 full, we know that 1/3 of x is equal to 16 gallons.
Multiply both sides by 3: x = 16 * 3
x = 48 gallons

Mel is three years younger than Katherine.  When Katherine is two dozen years old, how old will Mel be in years?
Answer:
21
Response:
Let's break this down step by step:

* Mel is three years younger than Katherine, so if Katherine's age is X, Mel's age is X - 3.
* When Katherine is two dozen years old, her age will be 2 * 12 = 24.
* Since Mel is three years younger than Katherine, Mel's age will be 24 - 3 = 21.

Therefore, when Katherine is two dozen years old, Mel will be 21 years old.

Milo can roll downhill on his skateboard at twice the speed that he can run.  And Milo's best friend, Cory, can drive his wheelchair at twice the speed that Milo can roll downhill on his skateboard.  If Cory always drives his wheelchair at 12 miles per hour, how many miles can Milo run in two hours?
Answer:
6
Response:
<reasoning>
Given that Cory drives at 12 miles per hour.
If Cory drives twice as fast as Milo can roll downhill, then Cory is twice as fast as Milo can run.
Since Cory is twice as fast as Milo can run, then it must be that Milo can run twice as fast as Cory can drive his wheelchair.
Since Cory can drive his wheelchair at 12 miles per hour, then Milo must be running at 12 / 2 = 6 miles per hour.
Then in 2 hours, at a speed of 6 miles per hour, Milo can run 6 * 2 = 12 miles.
</reasoning>

Cory can drive 12 miles per hour.

Since Cory always drives at 12 miles per hour, then the time is 2 hours, and the distance he ran is 12 miles.

Three old cars displayed in an auction event have different manufacture dates. The first car, made in 1970,  was made 10 years earlier than the second car. The third car was manufactured 20 years later after the second car was manufactured. Calculate the year that the third car was made.
Answer:
2000
Response:
Let's break it down step by step:

1. The first car was made in 1970 and was made 10 years earlier than the second car. So, the second car was made in 1970 + 10 = 1980.
2. The third car was made 20 years later than the second car, so it was made in 1980 + 20 = 2000.

Therefore, the third car was made in 2000.

-------------------- Question:
CJ, KJ, and AJ collect stamps.  CJ has 5 more than twice the number of stamps that KJ has, and KJ has half as many as AJ.  If the three boys have 930 stamps all together, how many stamps does AJ have?
Answer:
370
Response:
Let's assign variables to represent the number of stamps each boy has. Let A represent the number of stamps AJ has, K represent the number of stamps KJ has, and C represent the number of stamps CJ has.

We know that AJ has half as many stamps as KJ, so we can write the equation A = K/2.

We also know that CJ has 5 more than twice the number of stamps KJ has, so we can write the equation C = 2K + 5.

The total number of stamps the boys have is 930, so we can write the equation A + K + C = 930.

We can substitute the expressions for A and C from the previous equations into the total equation:

K/2 + K + 2K + 5 = 930.

Now we can simplify and solve for A (AJ) in terms of K, and solve for K in terms of A.

Combining like terms in the equation:

7K + 5 = 930.

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

7K = 925.

Dividing both sides by 7:

K = 130.71.

However, K must be a whole number, so we round down to 130.

Now, substituting K = 130 back into A = K/2:

A = 130/2.
A = 65.

Therefore, AJ has 65 stamps.

Anahi bought a 500 pages book to write some notes on. In the first week, she wrote on 150 pages. In the second week, she wrote on 30% of the remaining pages. While continuing writing, she accidentally spilled coffee on the book and damaged 20 percent of the empty pages she was to write on. Calculate the total number of empty pages available for her to write on now.
Answer:
196
Response:
To find the number of pages left after the first week, first find 30% of 500 which is 150. This leaves 500 - 150 = 350 pages.

She wrote on 150 pages. This leaves 350 - 150 = 200 pages.

20% of these is 0.2 * 200 = 40 pages. So she spilled on 40 pages.

200 - 40 = 160 pages.

John carves a giant marble rectangular prism 8 meters tall with a 2-meter square base.  It has a density of 2700 kg per cubic meter.  How much does it weigh?
Answer:
86,400
Response:
To find the weight of the prism, we need to calculate the volume and multiply it by the density.

The volume of a rectangular prism is calculated by:

Volume = Length × Width × Height
In this case, the length and width are both 2 meters, and the height is 8 meters:

Volume = 2 × 2 × 8
Volume = 32 cubic meters

Now, multiply the volume by the density (2700 kg per cubic meter):

Weight = Volume × Density
Weight = 32 × 2700
Weight = 86400 kg

So, the weight of the prism is 86,400 kg.

Clyde and Grace are building block towers. Grace’s tower is 8 times the size of Clyde’s at 40 inches tall. How many inches taller is Grace’s tower than Clyde’s?
Answer:
35
Response:
<reasoning>
If Clyde's tower is x inches, then Grace's tower is 8x inches.
Since the height is in inches, we can set up the equation:
8x = 40
Dividing both sides by 8, we get:
x = 5
So Clyde's tower is 5 inches tall.
Grace's tower is 8x = 40 inches tall.
The difference in height is:
40 - 5 = 5
Grace's tower is 5 inches taller than Clyde's.

Tina made a large pan of brownies and cut it into 24 pieces.  She had one with lunch and dinner every day for 5 days.  Her husband snagged one per day for 5 days to take to work.  They shared 4 with dinner guests.  How many brownies were left?
Answer:
5
Response:
To find out how many brownies Tina had left, we need to subtract the number of brownies she gave away from the total.

She had 24 brownies initially and gave 4 to dinner guests.
24 - 4 = 20

She also gave some to her husband and Tina's dinner guests.  Her husband had 8 brownies and the dinner guests had 4, for a total of
8 + 4 = 12.

So, in total, she gave away or had 12 brownies.

Now, we subtract the total number of brownies given away from the initial number of brownies:
24 - 12 = 12

Therefore, Tina had 12 brownies left.

Bob gets rent assistance because he's low-income. If he gets a raise of $0.50/hour and works 40 hours a week, how much more will he actually earn a week if his housing benefit is reduced by $60/month?
Answer:
5
Response:
To find the additional increase in Bob's weekly earnings due to the housing benefit reduction, we first need to calculate how many months are in a year and then determine how many hours Bob works in a month, given that he works 40 hours a week.

There are 12 months in a year, and Bob works 40 hours a week, so:
- In a year, Bob works 40 hours/week * 12 weeks/year = 480 hours/year.

Now, let's calculate how many months are in a year:
- A year has 12 months.

Since we already know Bob works 480 hours in a year, we can calculate his weekly earnings:
- Earnings per week = 480 hours/year / 52 weeks/year = 9.23 hours/week.

Now, let's calculate how much more he will earn after a $60/month reduction:
- First, calculate his new weekly earnings after the reduction:
  - New earnings per week = original earnings per week - reduction per month
  - New earnings per week = 9.23 hours/week - (60 / 12) = 9.23 - 5 = 4.23 hours/week.

- Finally, calculate the increase in his weekly earnings:
  - Increase per week = new earnings per week - original earnings per week
  - Increase per week = 4.23 hours/week - 9.23 hours/week = -4.99 hours/week.

Therefore, Bob will actually earn $4.99 less per week after the housing benefit reduction.

-------------------- Question:
Kayden's business delivered an equal number of the 400 cartons of milk it had processed to four of its customers in different towns. However, each of the four customers returned 60 cartons damaged during delivery. What's the total number of cartons that were accepted by the customers?
Answer:
160
Response:
To find the total number of cartons accepted, we need to find the number of cartons each customer received and multiply it by the number of customers.

Since each customer received an equal number of cartons, and there are 400 cartons in total, the number of cartons each customer received is:

400 / 4 = 100

Since 60 cartons were returned, the number of cartons accepted is:

100 - 60 = 40

So, the total number of cartons accepted by the customers is 40.
