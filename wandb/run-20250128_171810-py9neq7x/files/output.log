Invalidate trace cache @ step 0 and module 460: cache has only 0 modules
-------------------- Question:
Ahmed and Emily are having a contest to see who can get the best grade in the class. There have been 9 assignments and Ahmed has a 91 in the class. Emily has a 92. The final assignment is worth the same amount as all the other assignments. Emily got a 90 on the final assignment. What is the minimum grade Ahmed needs to get to beat Emily if all grades are whole numbers?
Answer:
100
Response:
To solve this, we'll first assume Emily's grade is the minimum grade she can have for the class. This is 90.

For Ahmed to beat Emily, his final grade must be higher than 90. Given that all other assignments were the same, the difference between the two can only come from the final assignment.

The difference between Ahmed's grade and Emily's grade on the final assignment is 2. Therefore, Ahmed must get at least 92 on the final assignment to beat Emily.

-------------------- Question:
Marie has 98 unread messages on her phone. She decides to clear them by reading 20 messages a day. However, she also gets 6 new messages a day. How many days will it take her to read all her unread messages?
Answer:
7
Response:
<reasoning>
To find out how many days it will take, divide the number of unread messages by the number of messages read per day, then subtract the number of messages that arrive. To find this value first divide 98 by 20 and subtract 6, or 4.84 and round down to 4.84. So subtract the number of messages that arrive.
</reasoning>

<answer>
4.84 days

-------------------- Question:
Mary bought a packet of 1500 stickers. She shared them between Susan, Andrew and Sam in the ratio 1:1:3 respectively. If Sam gave Andrew two-thirds of his own share, how many stickers does Andrew now have?
Answer:
900
Response:
<reasoning>
Let the initial share of Sam, Andrew and Susan be 3x, 3x, 4x respectively.
Then, the total number of stickers = 3x + 3x + 4x = 10x
Sam's share = (4/10) * 1500 = 600 stickers
So, Andrew's share = 3x = (3/10)* 1500 = 450 stickers
Also, Sam gives 2/3 of his share = 2/3 * 600 = 400 stickers
So, Andrew now has = 450 - 400 = 50 stickers.

A thirsty traveler found an oasis in the desert. He drank 32 ounces of water. His camel drank seven times as much as he did. There are 128 ounces in a gallon. How many gallons of water did they drink altogether?
Answer:
2
Response:
<reasoning>
First, find the amount of water the camel drank by multiplying 32 ounces by 7, which is 224 ounces.
Next, add the amount the traveler drank to the amount the camel drank to get the total amount, which is 32 + 224 = 256 ounces.
Finally, convert the total ounces to gallons by dividing 256 ounces by 128, which is 2 gallons.

Frank invites his friends over to play video games. He bakes a pan of brownies before he arrives. He cuts 6 even columns and 3 even rows into the pan of brownies. If there are 6 people, including Frank, in total, how many brownies can they each eat?
Answer:
3
Response:
If the pan of brownies is divided into 6 even columns and 3 even rows, it means each column can have 2 brownies (since there are 6/2 = 3 columns) and each row can have 3 brownies (since there are 3/2 = 1.5 rows, but since rows must be whole numbers, let's round down to 3, so there are 3 columns with 3 brownies each). However, I will round up the rows to 4, so there are 4 columns with 3 brownies each, because that will make the number divisible by 4 (the number 0 or 4).

So, the total number of brownies is (6 columns * 3 brownies column) + (3 rows * 4 brownies row) =
18 + 12 =
30

There are 6 people, including Frank, and they will eat 5 brownies each. So, the total number of brownies they can eat is 5 * 6 =
30

They can eat 30 brownies together.

Cathy and Chris got summer jobs at the cake shop and were supposed to work 20 hours per week each for 2 months. During that time, Chris got sick for one week and Cathy took her shifts. If there are four weeks in a month, how many hours did Cathy work during the 2 months?
Answer:
180
Response:
<reasoning>
2 months is 2 x 4 = 8 weeks.
Since Chris got sick for one week, Cathy worked 8 - 1 = 7 weeks.
Cathy worked 20 hours per week for 7 weeks, so that is 20 x 7 = 140 hours.

John went on a mission that was supposed to take 5 days.  Instead it took 60% longer.  He then had to go on a second mission which took 3 days.  How long was he on missions?
Answer:
11
Response:
<reasoning>
The first mission took 60% longer, so it took 1.6 times as long as the original 5-day mission. Let's call the length of the original 5-day mission x:
The first mission then took 5x * 1.6 = 8x days.
The second mission took 0.75 times as long as the first mission, which is 3 days.
8x + 3 = (5x * 1.6) + 3
8x + 3 = 8x + 3.6
Subtracting 8x from both sides:
3 = 3.6
This is incorrect since the x is not defined.
Let's look at it differently if the first mission took 5 days, it then took 60% longer.
60% longer than 5 days is 110% of 5 days, or 5*1.6 = 8 days.
If the first mission took 8 days, the second mission took 3 days.
Total days is 8 + 3 = 11.

Michael has two brothers. His oldest brother is 1 year older than twice Michael's age when Michael was a year younger. His younger brother is 5 years old, which is a third of the age of the older brother. What is their combined age?
Answer:
28
Response:
To find Michael's age, let's use 'x' for his age.

Since Michael's older brother is 1 year older than twice Michael's age, the older brother's age is 2x + 1.
Their younger brother is 5 years old, which is a third of the age of the older brother, so the younger brother's age is (2x + 1)/3.

We know that the younger brother's age is 5.
(2x + 1)/3 = 5
2x + 1 = 15
2x = 14
x = 7

Now that we have Michael's age, we have all the ages.
Michael's age = x = 7
Oldest brother's age = 2x + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15
Younger brother's age = (2x + 1)/3 = (2(7) + 1)/3 = 15/3 = 5

So, Michael's age is 7 and the older brother's age is also 15. The younger brother's age is 5. Their combined age is 7 + 15 + 5 = 27.

-------------------- Question:
A banana tree has 100 bananas left after Raj cut some bananas from it. If Raj has eaten 70 bananas and has twice as many remaining in his basket, how many bananas were on the tree initially?
Answer:
310
Response:
<reasoning>
We can start by letting x represent the number of bananas that were initially on the tree.
Since Raj cut 100 bananas and ended up eating 70, we know that x - 100 - 70 = 7, because Raj ate 70 bananas more than the initial amount.
Simplifying this equation we get x = 170.
Since Raj had twice as many remaining in his basket as the initial amount, we can set up the equation 2x = 70, since 2 times the initial amount is twice the number in the basket.
Solving for x we get x = 35, this is the amount of bananas that were eaten by Raj.
Therefore, the initial amount of bananas on the tree was 170 - 35 = 135.

Susy goes to a large school with 800 students, while Sarah goes to a smaller school with only 300 students.  At the start of the school year, Susy had 100 social media followers.  She gained 40 new followers in the first week of the school year, half that in the second week, and half of that in the third week.  Sarah only had 50 social media followers at the start of the year, but she gained 90 new followers the first week, a third of that in the second week, and a third of that in the third week.  After three weeks, how many social media followers did the girl with the most total followers have?
Answer:
180
Response:
<reasoning>
To find the total number of followers for Susy, we need to calculate the number of followers she gained in each week and add them up. In the first week, she gained 40 new followers. In the second week, she gained half of 40, which is 20. In the third week, she gained half of 20, which is 10. So Susy gained a total of 40 + 20 + 10 = 70 new followers. Adding the initial 100 followers, Susy now has 100 + 70 = 170 followers.
To find the total number of followers for Sarah, we need to calculate the number of followers she gained in each week and add them up. In the first week, she gained 90 new followers. In the second week, she gained a third of 90, which is 30. In the third week, she gained a third of 30, which is 10. So Sarah gained a total of 90 + 30 + 10 = 130 new followers. Adding the initial 50 followers, Sarah now has 50 + 130 = 180 followers.

In a Volleyball competition, Lizzie was able to score 4 points. Nathalie's score is 3 more than Lizzie's score and Aimee's score is twice the score of Lizzie and Nathalie combined. The rest of the points were made by their teammates. If the whole team was able to score 50 points, how many points did their teammates make?
Answer:
17
Response:
Let's break down the information given:

1. Lizzie scored 4 points.
2. Nathalie's score is 3 more than Lizzie's score, so Nathalie scored 4 + 3 = 7 points.
3. Aimee's score is twice the score of Lizzie and Nathalie combined, so Aimee's score is 2 x (Lizzie's + Nathalie's) = 2 x (4 + 7) = 2 x 11 = 22 points.

Total team score: 50
Team score made by Lizzie, Nathalie, and Aimee: 4 + 7 + 22 = 33
Points made by their teammates: 50 - 33 = 17
